        <h2>THE HISTORY OF THE CASTLE: MORE THAN 1,000 YEARS CONTEMPLATE</h2>
        <br><br>
        The Castillo de San Marcos is a fortress in the centre of El Puerto de Santa María, whose final appearance is the product of several construction phases throughout its long history. The essence of the building is shared by Romans and Andalusians, as well as by Christian kings and dukes, making the place a marvellous mixture of styles that visitors can enjoy.
        <br><br>
        Although it is true that there is evidence of human activity since Phoenician times, the urban centre of this town in Cádiz arose as a result of a Roman settlement through which the Via Augusta would pass on its way to Gades, called Portus Gaditanus. We can date this merchant city founded by Lucius Cornelius Balbus “'the Lesser”' to around I BC. - II A.D., observing some of its remains in the form of column shafts or foundations of buildings inside the Castle of San Marcos.
        It was in the Andalusian period when, in an act of territorial control, a Caliphate mosque with a Cordovan imprint was built on the possible remains of an earlier Late Roman or Visigothic building.
        <br><br>
        This mosque, of which there is still evidence, served as the basis for the construction of the fortified church of Santa María de El Puerto, carried out after the conquest of the territory by the Christian king Alfonso X El Sabio in 1264. All this was recorded by the monarch in the Cantigas de Santa María, a first-hand document that helps to interpret the vicissitudes of the construction of a sanctuary whose remains can be seen today in places such as the chapel inside the hall.
        <br><br>
        In the Modern Period, with the city in the hands of the House of Medinaceli, another major renovation of the building took place. Specifically, during the duchy of Luis de la Cerda (1479-1501), works such as the exterior wall and the church sacristy were carried out, coinciding with a period of splendour for the city due to the discovery and conquest of the American continent.
        <br><br>
        The Castle of San Marcos was key to this historical event, possibly housing such important personalities as Alonso de Ojeda, discoverer of the mouth of the Amazon River; Juan de la Cosa, who reflected the silhouette of the New Continent for the first time on a map drawn up in the year 1500 or Christopher Columbus himself.
        <br><br>
        It was in the last century that the monument took on its current form and became the property of the Caballero Group, following its declaration as an Asset of Cultural Interest.

      <h2>LIFE'S JOURNEY: FROM YOUR FIRST STEPS TO YOUT NEW BEGINNING</h2>
      <br><br>
      Like many parents, when you were born, we began a journey full of firsts, of shared learning, of hugs that healed and looks that spoke volumes.
      <br><br>
      Thanks to that moment I had a new nickname, mum, thanks to that moment I discovered a new way of loving, thanks to that moment your father and I started a beautiful family, and, thanks to you, your brother's growth was much easier, with the help you gave us without asking for it, with how you shared with him even what you didn't have, with how you were his pillar of support, his caregiver, counsellor and teacher. That complicity is one of the greatest joys of our lives.
      <br><br>
      Time, almost without asking permission, went by, and, stage after stage, we saw you grow, evolve and dream. One day, your first communion arrived, and shortly after, adolescence, and it was at that moment that we began to notice how you were leaving childhood behind. You grew up, you changed, and with each step you took, we were filled with a great illusion accompanied by that small fear of seeing the nest become a little emptier, and although we knew that one day the moment would come when you would embark on your own path, we still saw it as a long way off.
      <br><br>
      Until suddenly, you showed us a ring.
      <br><br>
      Time stood still. For an instant we didn't know what to say. It was as if all the memories flashed before us in a second, your first steps, your laughter, your anger, your tears, your voice calling out to us in the night. It was hard for us to assimilate, but in a heartbeat, we understood that the moment had arrived. And far from scaring us, it filled our hearts with joy.
      <br><br>
      Today, seeing you here, so in love, so determined, so full of illusion, we feel that our pride does not fit in our chest. You have come a long way, and the best is yet to come.
      <br><br>
      Today you are starting a new stage, you are beginning a journey in which there will be joys and annoyances, silences and words, sunny days and the odd storm, but there will also be the love that unites you, the complicity that you share and the strength that those who walk hand in hand have, and we hope that it will never be lacking in your luggage
      <br><br>
      Finally, I wanted these words to be with you always.
      <br><br>
      I want you to listen to me without judging me.
      <br><br>
      I want you to express your opinion without imposing me.
      <br><br>
      I want you to trust me without demanding me.
      <br><br>
      I want you to help me without deciding for me.
      <br><br>
      Because true love does not bind, it accompanies. And when it accompanies with the soul, everything flourishes.
      <br><br>
