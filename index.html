        <h2>THE HISTORY OF THE CASTLE: MORE THAN 1,000 YEARS CONTEMPLATE</h2>
        <br><br>
        The Castillo de San Marcos is a fortress in the centre of El Puerto de Santa María, whose final appearance is the product of several construction phases throughout its long history. The essence of the building is shared by Romans and Andalusians, as well as by Christian kings and dukes, making the place a marvellous mixture of styles that visitors can enjoy.
        <br><br>
        Although it is true that there is evidence of human activity since Phoenician times, the urban centre of this town in Cádiz arose as a result of a Roman settlement through which the Via Augusta would pass on its way to Gades, called Portus Gaditanus. We can date this merchant city founded by Lucius Cornelius Balbus “'the Lesser”' to around I BC. - II A.D., observing some of its remains in the form of column shafts or foundations of buildings inside the Castle of San Marcos.
        It was in the Andalusian period when, in an act of territorial control, a Caliphate mosque with a Cordovan imprint was built on the possible remains of an earlier Late Roman or Visigothic building.
        <br><br>
        This mosque, of which there is still evidence, served as the basis for the construction of the fortified church of Santa María de El Puerto, carried out after the conquest of the territory by the Christian king Alfonso X El Sabio in 1264. All this was recorded by the monarch in the Cantigas de Santa María, a first-hand document that helps to interpret the vicissitudes of the construction of a sanctuary whose remains can be seen today in places such as the chapel inside the hall.
        <br><br>
        In the Modern Period, with the city in the hands of the House of Medinaceli, another major renovation of the building took place. Specifically, during the duchy of Luis de la Cerda (1479-1501), works such as the exterior wall and the church sacristy were carried out, coinciding with a period of splendour for the city due to the discovery and conquest of the American continent.
        <br><br>
        The Castle of San Marcos was key to this historical event, possibly housing such important personalities as Alonso de Ojeda, discoverer of the mouth of the Amazon River; Juan de la Cosa, who reflected the silhouette of the New Continent for the first time on a map drawn up in the year 1500 or Christopher Columbus himself.
        <br><br>
        It was in the last century that the monument took on its current form and became the property of the Caballero Group, following its declaration as an Asset of Cultural Interest.

      <h2>LIFE'S JOURNEY: FROM YOUR FIRST STEPS TO YOUR NEW BEGINNING</h2>
      <br><br>
      Like many parents, when you were born, we began a journey full of firsts, of shared learning, of hugs that healed and looks that spoke volumes.
      <br><br>
      Thanks to that moment I had a new nickname, mum, thanks to that moment I discovered a new way of loving, thanks to that moment your father and I started a beautiful family, and, thanks to you, your brother's growth was much easier, with the help you gave us without asking for it, with how you shared with him even what you didn't have, with how you were his pillar of support, his caregiver, counsellor and teacher. That complicity is one of the greatest joys of our lives.
      <br><br>
      Time, almost without asking permission, went by, and, stage after stage, we saw you grow, evolve and dream. One day, your first communion arrived, and shortly after, adolescence, and it was at that moment that we began to notice how you were leaving childhood behind. You grew up, you changed, and with each step you took, we were filled with a great illusion accompanied by that small fear of seeing the nest become a little emptier, and although we knew that one day the moment would come when you would embark on your own path, we still saw it as a long way off.
      <br><br>
      Until suddenly, you showed us a ring.
      <br><br>
      Time stood still. For an instant we didn't know what to say. It was as if all the memories flashed before us in a second, your first steps, your laughter, your anger, your tears, your voice calling out to us in the night. It was hard for us to assimilate, but in a heartbeat, we understood that the moment had arrived. And far from scaring us, it filled our hearts with joy.
      <br><br>
      Today, seeing you here, so in love, so determined, so full of illusion, we feel that our pride does not fit in our chest. You have come a long way, and the best is yet to come.
      <br><br>
      Today you are starting a new stage, you are beginning a journey in which there will be joys and annoyances, silences and words, sunny days and the odd storm, but there will also be the love that unites you, the complicity that you share and the strength that those who walk hand in hand have, and we hope that it will never be lacking in your luggage
      <br><br>
      Finally, I wanted these words to be with you always.
      <br><br>
      I want you to listen to me without judging me.
      <br><br>
      I want you to express your opinion without imposing me.
      <br><br>
      I want you to trust me without demanding me.
      <br><br>
      I want you to help me without deciding for me.
      <br><br>
      Because true love does not bind, it accompanies. And when it accompanies with the soul, everything flourishes.

      <br><br>
      Hello, good afternoon ...
      <br><br>
      Beautiful words from Ana’s mother (ANA), truly touching, wise, and above all, heartfelt. Now let’s see what I’m going to say...
      <br><br>
      A few months ago, Ana and Ale told me they would like me to say a few words today, my first thought was: they have no idea what they’ve done, knowing how little I like speaking... but then they quickly said the magic words... “No more than 10 minutes...” ayrrr!!! Anyway... here we are!
      <br><br>
      MARRIAGE, as defined by the Royal Spanish Academy, is the union of two people, arranged through certain rites or legal formalities, to establish and maintain a shared community of goods and interests. 
      Legal formalities, for sure, they’ve had them ... inquiries at the Civil Registry, at the City Hall, the German Consulate, appointment scheduled since 2024, the required witness, one day I find out Enma is going to Germany, “I’m going to Frankfurt next week”... NANI / WHAT??!!... Well, here we’ll be waiting me and the dog ...
      But then, out of the mist, the witness appeared, who happened to be planning a business trip to Germania and became the savior. So that bureaucratic path, successfully completed, has brought us to this very moment.
      <br><br>
      As we were saying just a moment ago (or more)... MARRIAGE, with its formal definition, ... fine, /okay ... , but I’d like to focus on an aspect that I believe is essential for it to work well, COMPLICITY, which involves collaboration, cooperation, shared understanding, agreement, and mutual participation.
      It means: being together physically and mentally, understanding each other and complementing one another.
      <br><br>
      It must be such that even without words, with just a gesture or a look, both of you know what the other is thinking ... or?! Is it the contracting party of the first part who must be considered the contracting party with the second part... Ana, Alejandro... here, there are no contracting parties that’s for the legal definition... HERE, YOU ARE ONE WHOLE!!
      <br><br>
      That implies a deep understanding that goes beyond words, it means empathy, communicating through looks, and closeness. A kind of knowledge between two people that isn’t shared with anyone else.
      <br><br>
      Still, in trying to express to you how important this element of relationships is, I looked for quotes, definitions, and perspectives that might help us grasp the complexity and, at the same time, the brilliance of complicity and I found a quote from BOCACCIO that says:
      “DESTINY DOES NOT RULE WITHOUT THE SECRET COMPLICITY OF INSTINCT AND WILL.”, This Boccaccio guy was clever.
      <br><br>
      To me, that’s the best definition, because it conveys everything about this aspect of relationships that, in your case, you’ve now formalized.
      <br><br>
      Ana, Alejandro... YOU TWO... from borrowing university notes and kindly sharing them, to now building your life together and those of us who know you more closely watch with joy and pride how your union of wills has grown.
      You have a WHOLE WORLD ahead of you, not only in the earthly sense, but also as a pure expression of your personal growth, together and individually, because your bond enriches you both.
      <br><br>
      You must have the will to care for and improve your relationship (and we’re all sure you will), because you show it in every moment. It’s a joy and pride for those of us who witness your evolution, every single time not only in person, but also through SOLTRAVEL (DO CHECK THEM OUT ON INSTAGRAM—as well as MOVEwhita, of course).
      <br><br>
      I’m not going to tell you that hard times might come and that you’ll need to be strong and ready for them... you know what!!... aaa Juiii the communications, when they come, you’ll overcome them and that’s it.
      <br><br>
      I won’t go on any longer, because I think I’ve gone over my time.
      <br><br>
      ENJOY LIFE, with your calm and beautiful way of being. Mataatode!! Or, in other words, Let’s go because we’re going!!
